# Bob expects the following code to print the names in alphabetical order. Without running the code, can you say whether it will? Explain your answer.

# names = { 'Chris', 'Clare', 'Karis', 'Karl',
#           'Max', 'Nick', 'Victor' }
# print(names)

I don't think the names will print in alphabetical order because the names are enclosed by curly brackets, indicating that names is a set, and sets are unordered collections.
