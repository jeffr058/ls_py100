# Predict the output of the code shown below. When you run the code, do you see what you expected? Why or why not?

list1 = [2, 6, 4]
list2 = [2, 6, 4]

print(list1 == list2)

# My solution
# Initially I thought it would be True but after deciding it was a probably a trick question (self-inflicted mind games) I predicted the output will be False because the lists themselves are not equal in value, even if the values of their elements are.
# When I ran the code, I didn't see False.
