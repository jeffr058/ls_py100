# What happens when you run the following code? Why?

# NAME = 'Victor'
# print('Good Morning, ' + NAME)
# print('Good Afternoon, ' + NAME)
# print('Good Evening, ' + NAME)

# NAME = 'Nina'
# print('Good Morning, ' + NAME)
# print('Good Afternoon, ' + NAME)
# print('Good Evening, ' + NAME)

It will run without problems, but the variable should be a constant, so it shouldn't be reassigned with a different value.
