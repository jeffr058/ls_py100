# Classify the following potential function names as idiomatic, non-idiomatic, or illegal. For the non-idiomatic and illegal names, explain your choice.

# Name
index           # idiomatic
CatName         # non-idiomatic (shouldn't be CamelCase)
lazy_dog        # idiomatic
quick_Fox       # non-idiomatic (should be all lowercase)
1stCharacter    # illegal (can't start with a number)
operand2        # idiomatic
BIG_NUMBER      # non-idiomatic (should be all lowercase)
Ï€               # non-idiomatic (non-ASCII character)

Answers are the same as for Exercise 1 as function naming convention is the same.
