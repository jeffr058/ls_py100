# my_list = [1, 2, 3, [4, 5, 6]]
# another_list = list(my_list)

# Given the above code, answer the following questions and explain your answers:

# 1. Are the lists assigned to my_list and another_list equal?
# 2. Are the lists assigned to my_list and another_list the same object?
# 3. Are the nested lists at index 3 of my_list and another_list equal?
# 4. Are the nested lists at index 3 of my_list and another_list the same object?
# Don't write any code for this exercise.

1. Yes, the equal values of each list make the lists equal.
2. The lists aren't the same object, but their elements point to the same objects in memory.
3. Yes, the nested lists are equal in value.
4. Yes, it is the same object.
