# Write a comprehension that creates a dict object whose keys are strings and whose values are the length of the corresponding key. Only keys with odd lengths should be in the dict. Use the set given by my_set as the source of strings.

my_set = {
    'Fluffy',
    'Butterscotch',
    'Pudding',
    'Cheddar',
    'Cocoa',
}

my_dict = { obj: len(obj) for obj in my_set }
print(my_dict)
