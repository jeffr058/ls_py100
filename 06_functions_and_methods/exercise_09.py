# Without running the following code, what do you think it will do?

# def foo(first, second=3, third=2):
#     print(first)
#     print(second)
#     print(third)

# foo(42, 3.141592, 2.718)

I think it will run 42, 3.141592, 2.718 because the second and third parameters are default parameters that will be used if no arguments for those parameters are given.
